# Hongkong-rental-market-analysis
the python crawler obtains data from the two mainstream rental markets in Hong Kong, and sums up the rental market situation in Hong Kong by using multiple visual tools and analysis methods based on Python, like the distribution of housing types and prices in various districts are all included. Finally, the linear regression prediction model was used to predict the rent, and the explanation degree reached 81 percent(R2).


## data soure
web scraping was basing on the BS4 and Parsel,using pycharm, and data was deriving in squarefoot and 28Hse
